# Dataset for Analyzing Stress Responses through ECG

## Overview
This dataset is part of the research project titled **"Analyzing Stress Responses through ECG: The Influence of Virtual Reality on Human Physiological Condition"**. It includes ECG recordings from 40 individuals under three different conditions: relaxing, stressed, and VR immersion.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of three CSV files, each representing a different condition:
1. `relaxing.csv`: ECG signals recorded during a relaxing state.
2. `stressed.csv`: ECG signals recorded during a stressed state.
3. `vr.csv`: ECG signals recorded during VR immersion.

### File Structure
Each CSV file contains the following structure:
- **Columns**: Time series data points of ECG signals.
- **Rows**: Individual recordings for each of the 40 subjects.

### Data Collection Method
- **Relaxing**: 5-minute recordings taken while subjects were in a relaxed state.
- **Stressed**: 5-minute recordings taken while subjects were exposed to stress-inducing stimuli.
- **VR Environment**: 5-minute recordings taken while subjects were immersed in a VR environment designed to reduce stress.

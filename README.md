# Analyzing Stress Responses through ECG: The Influence of Virtual Reality on Human Physiological Condition

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for the research project titled **"Analyzing Stress Responses through ECG: The Influence of Virtual Reality on Human Physiological Condition"**. The project investigates the potential of virtual reality (VR) environments to reduce stress and promote relaxation, utilizing electrocardiogram (ECG) data to analyze physiological responses.

## Project Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To create a VR environment that induces relaxation and reduces stress.
2. To collect and analyze ECG data from subjects in various conditions (rest, stress, and VR immersion).
3. To use machine learning models to assess changes in heart rate variability (HRV) as a measure of stress reduction.
4. To evaluate the statistical significance of VR-mediated stress reduction.

## Repository Structure
- `Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the VR environment, data collection, preprocessing, and analysis using machine learning models.
- `data/`: Folder containing sample ECG data used for the analysis.
- `results/`: Folder containing the results of the analysis and any generated plots.
